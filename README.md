# Adobe Lightroom Macro Pad

Although this firmware is functional, this project is a work in progress.

This is a Raspberry Pi Pico Lightroom Macro Pad based on CircuitPython. It's designed to work with 7 buttons or mechanical switches. One switch for choosing the mode and 6 switches to execute the macros/shortcuts.

More pictures and details once the project moves along.
